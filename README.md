# sBTC-BioLedger -  Crowdfunding Smart Contract (Stacks Blockchain)

## Overview

This **Clarity smart contract** implements a decentralized **crowdfunding and voting platform** on the **Stacks blockchain**.
It allows users to create projects, invest STX tokens, and vote on them transparently.

Each project has validation rules for titles, descriptions, funding goals, and time limits.
Investments and votes are tracked on-chain to ensure full transparency and immutability.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features

* **Project creation** with strict title and description validation.
* **STX investments** with minimum and maximum limits.
* **Voting system** for community feedback and approval.
* **Automatic project lifecycle management** (active ‚Üí expired).
* **Duplicate title protection** to prevent spam or confusion.
* **Comprehensive input validation and error handling.**

## üîí Validation Logic

### Title Validation

* Must be **4‚Äì50 characters**.
* Must not be empty or previously used.

### Description Validation

* Must be **10‚Äì500 characters**.
* Must not be empty.

### Project Validation

* Project ID must be between `1` and `project-counter`.
* Must exist and be active (status `"active"`).
* Must not have expired (`block-height < end-block`).

### Investment Validation

* Amount must be within `[min-investment, max-investment]`.
* Project‚Äôs total investment cannot exceed `max-investment`.

## üìú Public Functions

### 1. `create-project`

```clarity
(define-public (create-project 
    (title (string-ascii 50))

    (funding-goal uint))
```

**Purpose:**
Create a new crowdfunding project.

**Validations:**

* Title and description lengths checked.
* Funding goal must meet min/max thresholds.
* Title must not already exist.

**On success:**

* Saves project to the `projects` map.
* Registers title in `project-titles`.
* Initializes vote count in `vote-counts`.
* Returns `(ok project-id)`.

---

### 2. `invest`

```clarity
(define-public (invest (project-id uint) (amount uint))
```

**Purpose:**
Allows a user to invest STX in an active project.

**Validations:**

* Project ID must exist.
* Project must be active and not expired.
* Amount must be valid and within limits.
* Total investment must not exceed cap.

**Process:**

* Transfers STX from investor ‚Üí contract.
* Updates project‚Äôs `current-amount`.
